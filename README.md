# Experimental study of time series forecasting methods for groundwater level prediction

This repository contains the source code and the results of our work on comparing global vs local forecasting method for groundwater level prediction.

## Folders description
- `dataset_collection`: describes how the data is collected and provides helping scripts for downloading the data.
- `local_global_experiments`: Contains scripts for running the models on the datasets.
- `portfolio_experiments`: Contains a Jupyter notebook for visualising the datasets.
- `results`: Contains the result files and a Jupyter notebook for visualising the results in a human-friendly way.


## Dependencies
There are `conda` and `pip` dependencies respectively listed in the files `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt`. Both can be installed simultaneously using the following command:  
`conda env create -f=environment.yml`
